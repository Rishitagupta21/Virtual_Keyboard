Project Description:

The Virtual Keyboard is a software-based keyboard that allows users to input text using a graphical interface instead of a physical keyboard. It can be operated using a mouse, touch screen, or even gestures, making it useful for devices where physical keyboards are not available or practical.

This project simulates the functionality of a traditional keyboard through an interactive web or desktop application, displaying keys on the screen that can be clicked to type letters, numbers, or symbols. It provides a user-friendly interface and ensures accessibility for users with physical disabilities or on touch-enabled devices.

🔹 Objectives:

To design a functional on-screen keyboard interface.

To allow text input through mouse or touch.

To enhance accessibility and usability for all users.

To implement typing features such as shift, caps lock, and backspace.

🔹 Technologies Used:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend (optional): Python / Node.js (if connected with other systems)

Tools: VS Code, Web Browser

🔹 Key Features:

Interactive on-screen keys.

Supports alphabets, numbers, and special characters.

Visual feedback when a key is pressed.

Responsive design for different devices.

Can integrate with text fields for input.

🔹 Applications:

Touchscreen devices such as kiosks, tablets, or smart TVs.

Assistive technology for physically challenged users.

Security-sensitive environments (e.g., virtual PIN entry).

Multilingual typing support systems.
